# DAS 2010 Demonstration Data Products Disclosure Avoidance System Release 

This is the release of the US Census Bureau's Disclosure
Avoidance System that was used to generate the [2010 Demonstration Data Products released by the US Census Bureau on October 29, 2019](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/planning-management/2020-census-data-products/2010-demonstration-data-products.html).

This release contains the actual code that was used to transform the 
Census Edited File (CEF) that was used in the 2010 Census into a 
Microdata Detail File (MDF) that was then used to create the
demonstration DHC-P and DHC-H files that were then shared with stakeholders.

Also included in this release are two documents:
* [2010 DEMONSTRATION DATA PRODUCTS DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE SYSTEM
DESIGN SPECIFICATION v1.4.1](doc/2010-Demonstration-Data-Products-Disclosure-Avoidance-System-Design-Specification%20FINAL.pdf)
* [Census TopDown Algorithm: Differentially Private Data, Incremental Schemas, and Consistency with Public Knowledge](doc/20191020_1843_Consistency_for_Large_Scale_Differentially_Private_Histograms.pdf)
