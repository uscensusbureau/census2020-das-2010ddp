Our easier-to-read description of the DAS algorithm, as of the End-to-End Test release:
* https://github.com/uscensusbureau/census2020-das-e2e/blob/master/doc/20190711_0938_2018_E2E_Test_Algorithm_Description.pdf

Our more careful, succinct, eventually-intended-for-publication description of the same algorithm, and some of the theory surrounding it, circa the very recent Demonstration Data Products release: 
* https://github.com/uscensusbureau/census2020-das-2010ddp/blob/master/doc/20191020_1843_Consistency_for_Large_Scale_Differentially_Private_Histograms.pdf

The "specifications" document from the Demonstration Data Products release:

# Videos of presentations specific to the Census DAS project

Dan Kifer at Simons (detailed algorithm talk): 
* https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/tba-31

Phil Leclerc at Simons (rapid overview at intermediate level of a host of DAS issues, algorithmic & otherwise): 
* https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/practical-difficulties-application-differential-privacy-release-large-scale-public-data

William Sexton & Phil Leclerc at CNSTAT (very high-level overview of structure & state of DAS as of Demonstration Data Products release, as well as noted problems & intended fixes): 
* https://sites.nationalacademies.org/DBASSE/CNSTAT/DBASSE_196518 (search page for "Phil Leclerc" and "William Sexton"; other presentations may also be of interest)

Quick high-level DP background:

* Dwork-Roth monograph, chapters 1-3 (intro to the basics of most algorithmic issues, & to the general way of thinking about privacy formally): https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf
* Wood et al non-technical primer on DP (much easier read, less math; and a different focus, more interested in interpretation of privacy guarantee than algorithm design): https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/publications/differential-privacy-primer-non-technical-audience
